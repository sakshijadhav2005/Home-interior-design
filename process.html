I know what I like, but I just don’t know how to make it all come together. We hear this so often from our clients.
<br>This means it’s time—time to tap out (so to speak) and tap in a qualified interior designer! 
<br>Working with an interior designer eliminates the stress and overwhelm, eases the process of remodeling and building homes, 
<br>improves the functionality of your living space, and transforms your personal style and goals into a beautiful, cohesive home. 

If this is your first time working with an interior designer, you may be curious about the process.<br>
 You’re in the right place. We’ve created a step-by-step guide for working with an <br>
 interior designer to help you develop a good understanding of the interior design process before you begin.</h3>

<h2>Step One: The Discovery Phone Call </h2>

The first step in the interior design process is to get to know your potential interior designer with a discovery call.<br> This initial meet-and-greet is the perfect opportunity for both you and the interior designer to determine if working together is a good fit. 

<br>Your choice of interior designer shouldn’t be based solely on design style. While good style is obviously a determining factor,<br> it is important to remember that if design principles like balance, rhythm and repetition, contrast, and proportion, are well thought out, your space will come together in a cohesive way no matter what design style you choose.<br>
 So, find someone who: 

<br><h3>1]Will work within your timeline and budget.</h3>
<br><h3>2]Is a good listener and will not steamroll your ideas—a good designer should be able to easily add your personality into their design plans.</h3>
<br><h3>3]Can decipher your pain points and goals.</h3>
<br><h3>4]Not only has an eye for aesthetics, but also has a technical background and plenty of experience.</h3>
<br><h3>5]Once you are confident you have found a perfect match for your redesign, it’s time to schedule your in-person, on-site consultation.</h3>
<br><h2>Step Two: In-Person, On-Site Consultation</h2>

<br>The in-person, on-site consultation kicks off the start of your project (yay!).<br>
 Each design firm does things a little differently, but our initial consultation typically lasts two hours and is a paid service.<br>
 During your consultation, you will start to have conversations about functionality and style. This is your time to tell your designer all your hopes and dreams for your space!<br>
 Your designer may make some suggestions or have some design ideas to consider, but this meeting is largely about gathering as much information as possible to understand your needs.<br>
 This is also when your designer will go over the entire design process and your contract. <br>
<br><h2>Step Three: The Conceptual Design Phase</h2>

<br>Time to get excited—during the conceptual design phase, your designer is hard at work putting together their big vision for your home! 
<br>The designer will complete a site survey to take measurements and photos of your space.<br>
 You are also likely to receive access to a shared Pinterest board during this phase so that you and your designer can start to get inspired. <br>

This phase is also the time when initial floor planning begins—to develop good flow patterns and add desired features into your home.<br>
 If you opted to work with a designer who also has a technical background, you will likely see preliminary AutoCAD drawings of initial floor plans for full remodels and some options for furniture space plans.  
<br>
At the end of this phase, your designer will meet with you to review the initial plans, conceptual design ideas, <br>
and an estimated budget to ensure they are on track with the design intent. 
<br><h2>Step Four: The Design Development Phase</h2>

<br>After the initial plans are approved, the design development phase begins. <br>
This phase is kicked off with a “trade day” in which your interior designer will review the preliminary design ideas with the contractor and tradesmen to get initial bids for construction. 
<br>
Next, your interior design team will develop all drawings and iron out all the specifics (every little detail) while simultaneously sourcing all materials, fixtures and furnishings. 
<br>They will carefully select everything for your newly renovated home, including:


<div>

<br>1]Tile
<br>2]Lighting
<br>3]Finishes
<br>4]Countertops
<br>5]Cabinetry
<br>6]Paint colors
<br>7]Flooring
<br>8]Plumbing
<br>9]Appliances
<br>10]Furniture

</div>
</div>
Ready-made or custom pieces 

You get the idea!  Once the refined plans for your design are complete and selections are made,<br>
 your designer will request pricing from vendors and update the budget as well as the timeline.<br>

At the end of this phase, you will meet with your interior designer to review a finalized design presentation, tear sheets, and the physical material samples.<br> 
This design plan will be the most finished product up to this point. <br>
If something is not approved, the designer will reselect items, refine any construction drawings, and present you with the updated design. <br>
Once everything is approved, we move onto the final design phase.<br>
